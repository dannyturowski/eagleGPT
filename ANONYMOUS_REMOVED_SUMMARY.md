# Anonymous Showcase Removed - Summary

## Problem Identified
The server was running an old Docker image (ghcr.io/dannyturowski/eaglegpt:latest) that had the anonymous showcase compiled into the frontend JavaScript bundle. Simply patching the backend wasn't enough.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Restarted with existing image** but applied aggressive JavaScript patches
2. **Created remove-anonymous.js** - A runtime patch that:
   - Overrides the user store to always show a logged-in state
   - Removes preview banners and anonymous content
   - Hides any showcase or thread accordion elements
   - Continuously monitors and removes anonymous elements

3. **Injected patch into index.html** to ensure it loads on every page visit

4. **Applied demo backend files** for the demo authentication system

## Current State
- Anonymous showcase is removed via runtime JavaScript patch
- Demo mode backend is active (ENABLE_DEMO_MODE=true)
- Users visiting the site will see the standard OpenWebUI interface
- The patch aggressively removes any anonymous-specific UI elements

## Files Deployed
- `/app/build/remove-anonymous.js` - Runtime patch to remove anonymous content
- `/app/build/index.html` - Modified to include the patch
- Backend demo files (auths.py, demo_auth_data.py, etc.)

## Next Steps
To make this permanent, you should:
1. Build a new frontend without the anonymous showcase code
2. Create a proper Docker image with all changes
3. Replace the runtime patches with a clean build

For now, the runtime patches effectively hide the anonymous showcase and provide the desired experience.
