# Anonymous Showcase Page Completely Removed

## Problem
The site was showing an anonymous showcase page with:
- "Welcome to eagleGPT!"
- "Explore example conversations below and sign up to start your own"
- Example conversation threads
- Model selection UI

This content was compiled into the JavaScript bundles and previous runtime patches weren't fully removing it.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive JavaScript Patch
Created `remove-anonymous-page.js` that:
- Redirects all unauthenticated users to `/auth` immediately
- Aggressively removes any DOM elements containing anonymous showcase text
- Monitors for DOM changes and removes content continuously
- Overrides browser history methods to prevent navigation without auth

### 2. Immediate Auth Check
Added inline script that runs before any other JavaScript:
```javascript
if(!localStorage.getItem("token") && window.location.pathname !== "/auth"){
    window.location.href="/auth";
}
```

### 3. Deployment
- Removed old ineffective patches (demo-init.js, remove-anonymous.js)
- Deployed new comprehensive patch
- Updated index.html with both inline and external scripts

## Current Behavior
1. **Unauthenticated users**: Immediately redirected to `/auth` login page
2. **No anonymous content**: All showcase/preview content is removed
3. **Clean experience**: Users either see the login page or the authenticated interface

## Files Deployed
- `/app/build/remove-anonymous-page.js` - Comprehensive removal script
- `/app/build/index.html` - Updated with auth check and script inclusion

## Docker Image Update
Created `Dockerfile.no-anonymous` that includes all fixes permanently in the image.

## Result
✅ Anonymous showcase page is completely gone
✅ All unauthenticated users go directly to login
✅ No preview/demo content is visible
✅ Clean OpenWebUI experience with proper authentication flow
