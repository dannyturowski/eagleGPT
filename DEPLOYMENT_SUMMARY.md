# EagleGPT Deployment Summary - OpenWebUI v0.6.15

## Successfully Deployed

✅ **Latest OpenWebUI v0.6.15** - Running the most recent stable release
✅ **Demo mode backend files** - All custom Python files are included in the image
✅ **Runtime patches** - JavaScript files to remove anonymous showcase are deployed
✅ **Environment variables** - ENABLE_DEMO_MODE=true is set
✅ **Data persistence** - Using existing volumes for data and backups

## Current Status

1. **Frontend Patches Working**:
   - `/remove-anonymous.js` - Removes anonymous showcase elements
   - `/demo-init.js` - Auto-login script for anonymous users
   - Both scripts are loaded in the HTML

2. **Backend Demo Mode**:
   - Demo endpoint exists in the code (`/api/v1/auths/demo`)
   - However, returning 405 Method Not Allowed
   - This suggests the endpoint might not be properly registered with FastAPI

## What's Working

- Clean OpenWebUI interface without anonymous showcase
- Latest stable OpenWebUI features
- All user data preserved
- Runtime patches successfully hide anonymous content

## Known Issue

The demo authentication endpoint returns 405, which typically means:
- The route exists but the HTTP method isn't allowed
- Or the route isn't properly registered with the FastAPI app

## Image Details

- **Repository**: ghcr.io/dannyturowski/eaglegpt
- **Tags**: latest, v0.6.15
- **Base**: ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:v0.6.15
- **Customizations**: Demo mode backend, runtime patches

## Next Steps

To fully enable demo mode:
1. Debug why the demo endpoint returns 405
2. Ensure the route is properly registered in the FastAPI application
3. Test auto-login functionality once endpoint is working

The site is currently running the latest OpenWebUI without the anonymous showcase, which was the primary goal.
